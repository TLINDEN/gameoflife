- add all other options like size etc

- changing options mid-game has no effect in most cases, even after a restart

- RLE file loading works, but if world is larger than screen, center is invisible.

- Statefile loading does not work correclty anymore. With larger grids
  everything  is empty.  With square  grids part  of the  grid is  cut
  off. Smaller grids load though
