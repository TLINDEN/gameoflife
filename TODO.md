- add all other options like size etc

- if grid lines is disabled, they appear anyway in the first frame (then disappear)

- changing options mid-game has no effect in most cases, even after a restart

- RLE file loading works but pattern is barely visible

- Statefile loading does not work correclty anymore. With larger grids
  everything  is empty.  With square  grids part  of the  grid is  cut
  off. Smaller grids load though
  
- Same thing  with RLE files: with smaller grid  size, RLE file shows,
  but with larger (or default) grid size, its invisible
  
-  gridlines  vanish  if  starting  in menu  mode,  after  starting  a
  game.  They are  there in  all manual  modes and  on startup  before
  leaving the menu
